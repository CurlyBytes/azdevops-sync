# azdevops-sync
Sample project to sync Work Items and other items from one Azure DevOps Team Project to another.

# Description
[Here](https://www.slideshare.net/geniodelmale/azure-devops-realtime-work-item-sync-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly) you can find a presentation about the project, how it works, and so on.

# Help needed
- Documentation
- Updating comments in the code that are still in Italian.
- Porting to Azure Function 2.0 and to Azure DevOps SDK.
- Better error handling.
- Handling of other common cases.
- Video to show how it works.

# What's missing from myself
- Documentation on how to setup the project on Azure Functions
- Build and release pipelines to move test results back to the original Team Project
- Azure Function supporting the pipelines
